## Demo Day Presentation

Your Demo Day presentation is a `5` minute presentation composed of:

* an introduction to your project
* a summary of the problem or issue you hope to resolve
* a detailed discussion of your project and its audience/users
* a short profile of you and your expertise as it relates to the project
* a conclusion which reinforces the key points of your project

### Structure

#### `Introduction`

Likely the most difficult part to get right, the `Introduction` typically has its own formal conventions:

- [ ] the name of the project
- [ ] simple, succinct description of the project which is direct and _not abstract_
- [ ] the value/problem that the project, fully completed, will provide or solve
- [ ] evidence that provides scale or support for the value provided or problem addressed

While departures from this format obviously work, focusing on building your presentation from these elements
will help you to define your project in a clearer, more focused way.

#### `Problem Summary`

While your introduction convinces an audience to pay attention it's your job to convert listeners from interested
and attentive to receptive and (hopefully) supportive of your intervention or solution. Here, the following elements might
help structure your approach:

- [ ] identify and share the biggest issue or broadest description of issues you're aiming to solve
- [ ] quantify or qualify these issues with more specific evidence that:
  - points toward the _how_ (the _method_) you're solving the issue
  - provides a sense of scale or impact that a solution could have on the area of interest
- [ ] factor(s) that differentiate this attempt at creating value/solution from other similar efforts
  - namely, discuss how your solution differs (in, at most, `2` key aspects)

The point of this section shouldn't be to best competitors or other researchers, merely to demonstrate that there's
efficacy in your approach that explores new (or old!) opportunities.

Here, if you've got graphs or charts: bring 'em. Statstics that underscore your point? It's probably _now_ or never.

#### `Userbase` (alternatively, `Audience`)

Building software for _everyone_ isn't really possible, especially at our scale. Ideally, who is your user or audience?
This section doesn't immediately contemplate standard demographic information unless you're building something for a
specific age group, for example.

Profiling your typical user may help yourself and others identify potential logjams with interfaces, process assumptions,
or other user-dependent issues.

#### `Expertise`

You've hopefully chosen your project because you're either deeply interested in or especially suited to it. While you're
not expected to be an expert, you possess compelling details that make _you_ the right person to take this project forward.
Some areas to cover in this section (not limited to):

- [ ] any areas where you've completed coursework (esp. a minor concentration)
  - you don't need to list individual courses
- [ ] involvement in a community around/for which this project is built
- [ ] deep curiosity in a subject and its application
- [ ] a keen intent to work in a fielf encompassing or adjacent to your project

#### `Conclusion`

It's easy at this point to believe that your presentation, as full of content as it is, says and shows enough. However,
consider your `Conclusion` your opportunity to further shape and refine the impact that your 4-minute data dump will have.
To achieve this successfully, list the `3` or `4` facts about your project that you want the audience to remember. No need
to stealthily introduce these: it can be an explicit list of features with some reminders or re-situation. These points
constitute what you'd most like folks to ask you about after your presentations; they serve as points of engagement.

You want to leave your audience with a sense of concreteness and cohesiveness, arriving at the end of a highly-structured
and practiced `5` minutes whose conclusion feels clear and inevitable. Second only to the [`Introduction`](#introduction)
in difficulty, the `Conclusion` is possibly the most important section in the presentation: it serves as the _last_ thing
anyone will see or hear.

### Slides

The following guidelines and suggestions will appear arbitary and restrictive, but focus on a couple of key assumptions
derived from situations where slide decks go wrong:

1. Slides are not for the presenter (i.e., you)
2. Slides merely support a presentation and are not, themselves, a substitute for one

Similar to the description of the [presentation `Conclusion`](#conclusion), we'll assume that folks have a limited memory.

Let's follow [the former Y Combinator Partner Kevin Hale](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/how-to-design-a-better-pitch-deck/)
on a general rubric for _all_ slides:

> * Make it legible
> * Make it simple
> * Make it obvious

#### Design

##### On legibility

Many slides aren't _readable_ because color choices do not provide enough contrast (i.e. ability to differentiate between any
two colors on a slide). In addition, slides often cram a lot of type on a single slide (even slides for this course are
guilty of this). Here are there rules to heavily consider:

1. use a sufficiently large typeface for everyone in the room to read
2. pair colors which feature high difference (i.e. contrast)
3. use fewer than 10 words on a given slide

##### On density

Slides which feature multiple, competing ideas are confusing. Each slide's content should represent one idea and _only_ one idea.

##### On content

Looking at the amount of information expected to come from the presentation, we encounter a problem: how do we present this information
with restrictions that make it seem like there should only be `7` (or fewer) slides? We do it in `7` or fewer slides.

Keep in mind that this presentation is not for the presenter relaying the content. Slides shape the _experience_ of the physical 
presentation.
