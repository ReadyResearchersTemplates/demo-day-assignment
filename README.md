## Demo Day Presentation

Your Demo Day presentation is a `5` minute presentation composed of:

* an introduction to your project
* a summary of the problem or issue you hope to resolve
* a detailed discussion of your project and its audience/users
* a short profile of you and your expertise as it relates to the project
* a conclusion which reinforces the key points of your project

### Structure

#### `Introduction`

Likely the most difficult part to get right, the `Introduction` typically has its own formal conventions:

- [ ] the name of the project
- [ ] simple, succinct description of the project which is direct and _not abstract_
- [ ] the value/problem that the project, fully completed, will provide or solve
- [ ] evidence that provides scale or support for the value provided or problem addressed

While departures from this format obviously work, focusing on building your presentation from these elements
will help you to define your project in a clearer, more focused way.

#### `Problem Summary`

While your introduction convinces an audience to pay attention it's your job to convert listeners from interested
and attentive to receptive and (hopefully) supportive of your intervention or solution. Here, the following elements might
help structure your approach:

- [ ] identify and share the biggest issue or broadest description of issues you're aiming to solve
- [ ] quantify or qualify these issues with more specific evidence that:
  - points toward the _how_ (the _method_) you're solving the issue
  - provides a sense of scale or impact that a solution could have on the area of interest
- [ ] factor(s) that differentiate this attempt at creating value/solution from other similar efforts
  - namely, discuss how your solution differs (in, at most, `2` key aspects)

The point of this section shouldn't be to best competitors or other researchers, merely to demonstrate that there's
efficacy in your approach that explores new (or old!) opportunities.

#### `Userbase` (alternatively, `Audience`)

Building software for _everyone_ isn't really possible, especially at our scale. Ideally, who is your user or audience?
This section doesn't immediately contemplate standard demographic information unless you're building something for a
specific age group, for example.

Profiling your typical user may help yourself and others identify potential logjams with interfaces, process assumptions,
or other user-dependent issues.

#### `Expertise`

You've hopefully chosen your project because you're either deeply interested in or especially suited to it. While you're
not expected to be an expert, you possess compelling details that make _you_ the right person to take this project forward.
Some areas to cover in this section (not limited to):

- [ ] any areas where you've completed coursework (esp. a minor concentration)
  - you don't need to list individual courses
- [ ] involvement in a community around/for which this project is built
- [ ] deep curiosity in a subject and its application
- [ ] a keen intent to work in a fielf encompassing or adjacent to your project

#### `Conclusion`

It's easy at this point to believe that your presentation, as full of content as it is, says and shows enough.
